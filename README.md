# OR
npm install -g run.sh
# OR to curl directly, see https://github.com/evnp/run.sh#install
```

Install
-------

Homebrew:
```sh
brew tap evnp/run.sh && brew install run.sh
```
NPM:
```sh
npm install -g run.sh
```
curl:
```sh
read -rp $'\n'"Current \$PATH:"$'\n'"${PATH//:/ : }"$'\n\n'"Enter a directory from the list above: " \
  && curl -L -o "${REPLY/\~/$HOME}/run.sh" https://github.com/evnp/run.sh/raw/main/run.sh \
  && chmod +x "${REPLY/\~/$HOME}/run.sh"
```
run.sh has no external dependencies, but it's good practice to audit code before downrun.sh onto your system to ensure it contains nothing unexpected. Please view the full source code for run.sh here: https://github.com/evnp/run.sh/blob/master/run.sh

If you also want to install run.sh's man page:
```sh
read -rp $'\n'"Current \$MANPATH:"$'\n'"${MANPATH//:/ : }"$'\n\n'"Enter a directory from the list above: " \
  && curl -L -o "${REPLY/\~/$HOME}/man1/run.sh.1" https://github.com/evnp/run.sh/raw/main/man/run.sh.1
```
Verify installation:
```sh
run.sh -v
==> run.sh 2.0.2

brew test run.sh
==> Testing run.sh
==> /opt/homebrew/Cellar/run.sh/2.0.2/bin/run.sh test --print 1234 hello world
```

```sh
npm install
npm test
```
